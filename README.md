# 🌍 TRASCAN: Machine Learning Model for Waste Classification  

Welcome to the **TRASCAN** repository! This project is dedicated to building an intelligent waste classification model, empowering users to sort and manage waste effectively. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning and pre-trained EfficientNet architecture, TRASCAN categorizes waste into 28 distinct classes.
